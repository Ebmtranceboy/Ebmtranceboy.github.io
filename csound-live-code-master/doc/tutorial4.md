# Tutorial 4 - Making Music in a Modular Style 

_WARNING: This tutorial is currently being written and contains incomplete material. This notice will be removed once the tutorial is complete. Thank you!_

## Introduction

Learning Outcomes:

1. Learn to develop and design always-on instruments 
2. Learn to use Csound's channel system to route signals between instruments
3. Practice audio-rate sound programming in a modular synthesizer style 

## Concepts

In this tutorial, we will use Csound instruments in two primary ways:

1. "Rack" or "Patch" instruments: These are instruments we will be using to generate sounds.   
2. Mixer Instruments: Instruments for sound effect processing and mixing of signals from Rack instruments.
3. Modulation/Control Instruments: Instruments for controling parameters for Rack and Mixer instruments.
